# Getting and preparing ENTSO-E data for running the full analysis

* In order for the full analysis scripts to run, the ENTSO-E data needs to be copied in here.
* You can download the ENTSO-E data via SFTP, after prior registration, and email request for a private key. Information at:

* You require the 2018, 2019 and 2020 files from the folder "AggregatedGenerationPerType" and "ActualTotalLoad" from the ENTSO-E SFTP server.
* The files first need to be converted to UTF-8 (e.g. via notepad++ or similar editors).
